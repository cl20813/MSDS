Pyspark = Python + Apache Spark
Apache Spark is a new and open-source framework used in the big data industry for real-time processing and batch processing. 

## Pre-requisite installation is Python. 

## Java installation. In my case, it's Windows 64-bit.
1. Download Java -[here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
2. Go to "Command Prompt" and type "java -version" (space between java and -) to know the version and know whether it is installed or not. 
3. Copy Java path. In my case, "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21".
4. Go to search bar and "Edit the system environment"
5. Click into the "Environment Variables".
6. Click into "New" and use variable name as "JAVA_HOME" and copy paste java path into variable value. Then click 'Ok'.
7. Add the variable name as "PATH" and path value as "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21\bin", which is your location of Java bin file. Click 'OK'.
