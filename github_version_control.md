### I use Microsoft VScode to syncronize my projects with github.

1. Clone repository from Github:                
  - Navigate to ```View```>```Source Control```>```Clone Repository```.                   
  - The system will ask you to ```Authorize Visual Studio Code``` to log in to Github.
2. Make changes to the project files.
  - Edit the project files as needed.
3. Stage and sync your changes:
  - Go to the ```Source Control``` again.
  - Click ```Stage Changes```, add your commit message, and then ```Sync Changes(This will push or pull changes)```.
